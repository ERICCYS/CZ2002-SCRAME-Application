Guys, pls provide some notes here that you think is useful for teammates.

#### Note:
- `Use keyword static if this function needs to be called outside using Class_Name.Method_Name` e.g. Most methods inside Mgr classes need to be declared as `static`.
- For CSV file reader and write, there is a sample project "FileIOTest" please feel free to take it as reference. Any better idea is welcomed.

#### Happy Coding! Cheers!
