#### Use "Doing", "Done" to indicate the status. Empty status means "Unallocated"
#### Any problems, discuss in the group
#### In ensure enough time for reviewing, the code should be better done before `6 Nov 2018 (Wk12 Tue)`

Guys, pls provide some notes here that you think is useful for teammates.

#### Note:
- `Use keyword static if this function needs to be called outside using Class_Name.Method_Name` e.g. Most methods inside Mgr classes need to be declared as `static`.
- For CSV file reader and write, there is a sample project "FileIOTest" please feel free to take it as reference. Any better idea is welcomed.



#### Happy Coding! Cheers!
